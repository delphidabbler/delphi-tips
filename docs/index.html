<p><strong>Be warned</strong> that these tips are now quite old, few have ever been tested and those that have were tested on an old version of Delphi.</p>

<p>These tips are also available in PDF format and as a SQL database from the <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/delphi-tips">Delphi Tips GitHub Repository</a>. Additional tips will also be found there in the <code>extra</code> folder of that repository.</p>

<p>Any bugs in this site can be reported on the project's <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/delphi-tips/issues">issues page</a>. <small>(GitHub account required).</small></p>

<p>Corrections of any errors in the tips are welcome: use the same <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/delphi-tips/issues">issues page</a> to submit them. If you notice an error but don't provide a fix the tip will simply have a note about the error attached to it &ndash; it will not be fixed!</p>
